# rawdog-md

Caveman-level simple, minimal Markdown-to-HTML static blog tooling with minimal configuration.

## Core Concepts
- **Minimal Config**: rawdog-md is designed to be used with minimal configuration. Choose a template and immediately start writing your blog posts in markdown.
- **Opiniated**: This tool is not meant to be a general purpose static site generator. It is meant to be used for a very specific use case, which is a static blog with a few templated pages. If you want something more general purpose and more advanced, check out Hugo, Frontmatter, or Jekyll.
- **Bring your own styling (If you want)**: rawdog-md provides the minimal styling. However, it is very easy to adjust as it is just a CSS file.
- ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§ ~~**Cross platform**: You can use it on Windows, Linux and Mac.~~ 
- **Text editor agnostic**: You can use any text editor you want, as long as it can save files to disk.


## Installation
rawdog-md is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. You can install it via package managers, manually, or build it from source.

## Known Issues
- If you use VSCode as your editor and you're using auto save, set you delay longer than rebuild time. Otherwise, you might get an empty page because VSCode touches the file twice. See [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9419).
