## üëç You might want to use this if:
- You want to write your blog posts in markdown.
- You want to get started with writing your blog posts ASAP without caring much about config files.
- You don't wanna install things like Node.js, Ruby, or Python.
- You want to cook your own HTML and CSS and then forget about it.
- You want to host your blog on GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages.

## üëé You might not want to use this if:
- You want a full-fledged static site generator.
- You want to use a CMS.
- You have dynamic contents.
- You need advanced UI.

## üîë Core Concepts
- **Minimal Config**: rawdog-md is designed to be used with minimal configuration. Choose a starter template and immediately start writing your blog posts in markdown.
- **Opiniated**: This tool is not meant to be a general purpose static site generator. It is meant to be used for a very specific use case, which is a static blog with a few simple templated pages. If you want something more general purpose and more advanced, check out Hugo, Frontmatter, or Jekyll.
- **Bring your own styling**: rawdog-md provides the minimal styling. However, it is very easy to adjust as it is just a plain CSS and HTML file.
- **Cross platform**: You can use it on Windows, Linux and Mac. (Need testing on Mac and Linux)

## ‚ö† Known Issues
- If you use VSCode as your editor and you're using auto save, set your auto save delay longer than rebuild duration. Otherwise, you might get an empty page because VSCode touches the file twice. See [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9419).
