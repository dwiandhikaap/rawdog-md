# rawdog-md

Caveman-level simple, minimal Markdown-to-HTML static blog tooling with no configuration BS.

## Core Concepts
- **no config bs**: rawdog-md is designed to be used with minimal configuration. Choose a template and you can then start writing your blog posts in markdown immediately.
- **Highly opinionated**: This tool is not meant to be a general purpose static site generator. It is meant to be used for a very specific use case, which is a static blog with a few templated pages. If you want something more general purpose and more advanced, check out Hugo, Front Matter, or Jekyll.
- **Bring your own styling (If you want)**: rawdog-md only provides the bare minimum styling. However, it is very easy to adjust for your liking because it's just plain HTML and CSS. Which means you can use any CSS framework you want that doesn't require any build step.
- **fast enoughâ„¢**: It is not the fastest tool, but still faster than most npm/npx tools. ( I'm not sure what happens if you use Bun )
- ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§ ~~**Cross platform**: You can use it on Windows, Linux and Mac.~~ 
- **Text editor agnostic**: You can use any text editor you want, as long as it can save files to disk.
