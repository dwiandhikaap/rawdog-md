# Architecture of TODO App

This document provides an overview of the architecture and components of the TODO App.

## Overview

The TODO App is built using a modern web stack that allows for scalability and maintainability. Below are the main components of the application:

## Frontend

- **Framework**: The frontend is developed using React.js, which provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **State Management**: Redux is used for managing the application state, allowing for predictable state changes and easy debugging.
- **Styling**: CSS Modules and styled-components are utilized for component-level styling, ensuring modular and reusable styles.

## Backend

- **Server**: The backend is built with Node.js and Express, providing a robust server-side environment.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database, allowing for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **API**: A RESTful API is implemented to handle requests between the frontend and backend.

## File Structure

The file structure of the application is organized as follows:

```
todo-app/
│
├── client/                  # Frontend code
│   ├── src/                 # Source files
│   ├── public/              # Public assets
│   └── package.json         # Frontend dependencies
│
├── server/                  # Backend code
│   ├── models/              # Database models
│   ├── routes/              # API routes
│   └── server.js            # Main server file
│
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on cloud platforms such as Heroku or AWS. The deployment process includes:

1. Setting up environment variables for sensitive information.
2. Building the frontend for production.
3. Starting the server to listen for incoming requests.

## Conclusion

This architecture allows the TODO App to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly. We encourage contributions to improve the architecture further!
